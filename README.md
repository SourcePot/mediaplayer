# MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer is an App for Datapool which adds a video playlist feature to the web application. The App is added as a web page within the category *Apps*. It employs the Datapool App interface and the motivation was to use this App as a testcase for the App interface.
## How is it used
Datapool stores videos as well as other media as entries in the database table *multimedia*. The video files themself are stored in the *filespace* folder. Any video from *multimedia* can be linked to MediaPlayer playlists.
